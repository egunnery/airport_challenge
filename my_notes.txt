Hi! 

Unfortunately didn't get a huge amount done. It was slow going so I left out the video, would've been way too long. 

I think I've roughly completed the code for all user stories but couldn't get the RSpec to pass properly at the end. My code works in IRB, it's just how I have implemented the stormy weather story is having RSpec issues I can't get around at the moment, so I get one failure.

All I have to submit today is the code I did, don't have any notes either unfortunately so I hope it makes sense. I will submit what I have anyway and see what you guys think. 

Now I'm going back to bed. 

Enjoy your weekend!
